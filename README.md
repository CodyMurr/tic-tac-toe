# Tic-Tac-Toe


###About
---
In essense, the game of tic-tac-toe is painfully simple. My rendition of the classic game is no exception. The only major deviation from the original is my use of the colors "red" and "blue" as opposed the traditional x's and o's.

###Code
---
HTML/CSS/JS 

I used flexbox for style and functional programming/DOM manipulation to give it functionality.
